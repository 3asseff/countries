    <h1>Here is our 5 best countries!</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Canada
            <p>1.CAPITAL:Ottawa <br>2.REGION:North<br> 3.America GDP PER CAPITA, PPP:$50,661<br> 4.GDP:$1.74 trillion <br>5.POPULATION:37,593,384 <br>6.AREA: 9,984,670 SQ.KM</p>
            <p>Canada takes up about two-fifths of the North American continent, making it the second-largest country in the world after Russia. The country is sparsely populated, with most of its residents living within 125 miles of its border with the
                United States. Canada’s expansive wilderness to the north plays a large role in Canadian identity, as does the country’s reputation of welcoming immigrants.</p>

        <li>Denmark

            <p>Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, is home to notable institutions such as the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The capital also serves as a hub connecting Northern Europe with the rest of the world, with the largest international airport in Scandinavia,
                an active port, a subway system and the Oresund Bridge, connecting the city to Malmo, Sweden. Since 1849, Denmark has operated under a constitutional monarchy. Queen Margrethe II is the current ceremonial head of state and Lars Lokke Rasmussen
                is prime minister. The Folketing is Denmark’s supreme legislative body; its members are elected by the Danish people. The Danish government is perceived as highly stable and very transparent. Through progressive taxation, Denmark employs
                a universal health care system in which citizens receive mostly free medical care. Higher education is also free. Unsurprisingly, Denmark’s highly progressive government and societal structure creates incredible social mobility.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of Sweden, flanked by Norway to the west and the Baltic Sea to the east, expands across much of the Scandinavian Peninsula and is one of the largest countries in the European Union by land mass. Capital city Stockholm was claimed
                in the 16th century, and border disputes through the Middle Ages established the modern-day nation. Swedes are some of the world’s most generous people, donating about 1 percent of gross national product to humanitarian aid programs each
                year. The society continues to diversify as a growing number of refugees, currently accounting for 10 percent of the population, are welcomed into Swedish borders.

        <li>Norway

            <p>The Kingdom of Norway is the westernmost country in the Scandinavian peninsula, made up mostly of mountainous terrain. Nearly all of its population lives in the south, surrounding the capital, Oslo. Norway’s coastline is made up of thousands
                of miles of fjords, bays and island shores. The Norwegians developed a maritime culture, and were active throughout the Viking era, establishing settlements in Iceland and Greenland. For many years, Norway’s fate was tied to Denmark and
                Sweden. In 1905, Norway gained independence from Sweden through a referendum. The country was neutral during both World Wars but was nonetheless occupied by Nazi Germany for five years. Norway is a high income nation with a vibrant private
                sector and a substantial safety net. Discovery of oil and gas off the coast in the 1960s gave the country an economic boost and today Norway is one of the world's leading petroleum exporters.

            <p>Switzerland, officially called the Swiss Confederation, is a small country in Central Europe made up of 16,000 square miles of glacier-carved Alps, lakes and valleys. It’s one of the world’s wealthiest countries, and has been well-known for
                centuries for its neutrality. Switzerland has low unemployment, a skilled labor force and one of the highest gross domestic products per capita in the world, according to the CIA World Factbook. The country’s strong economy is powered
                by low corporate tax rates, a highly-developed service sector led by financial services and a high-tech manufacturing industry.
